To compile code:
	Requires the armadillo C++ linear algebra package
		https://arma.sourceforge.net
	Can easily isntalled using homebrew on Mac
		brew install armadillo
	Include and Lib paths needs be updated in MakeFile to reflect path on your system

	On Mac, compiling also requires using a gcc compiler installed with homebrew
		brew install gcc
	g++ version needs to updated in (CC) line to reflect your version

To run code:
	The only file to modify to run code is system.txt
		All inputs are labeled in the file

	Run code with ./fgr

	Code will generate 2 files:
		correlation.xvg
			C^{tau}(t) - columns 1 and 3 give the time and real value of the correlation function

		drivingForce.xvg
			epsilon, k, log_10(k)
